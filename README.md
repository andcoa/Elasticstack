# NixGuard

## Objective

To use the Elastic Stack (ELK)—Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana—for centralized log collection, analysis, and visualization in a SOC environment. Focused on using Kibana to identify and investigate security incidents through real-time dashboards and queries.

## Skills Learned

- 📈 Data Visualization with Kibana: Built dashboards and visualizations to monitor system activity, detect anomalies, and investigate security alerts.
- 🧠 Elasticsearch Querying: Queried indexed data using Kibana’s Lucene-based syntax to filter, analyze, and trace suspicious events.
- ⚙️ SIEM Integration: Leveraged Elastic Security features to simulate real-world SOC use cases such as user behavior monitoring and threat hunting.
- 🚨 Alert Investigation: Analyzed log patterns to identify potential IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) and respond to security events.

## Tools Used

- Kibana – Web UI for data visualization and querying logs stored in Elasticsearch.
- Elasticsearch – Scalable search and analytics engine for storing and indexing log data.

## Steps

Finding the IP address with maximum number of connections.
